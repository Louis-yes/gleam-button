# This is Louis code test for Gleam.
I've developed a vue component from a figma wireframe.

## Not included from the wireframes are:

- Dropdown variant
- Size variants
- Loading state

I left these out because I didn't want to spend too long developing it out.

**If I was to include them:**

- The dropdown variant 
  - would include another span, like the icon and badge variants
  - behaviour would be to toggle the active state on click, instead of being a mousedown/mouseup state
- The loading state would be a prop


## If I did it again
I would have asked up front what elements were most important, and focussed on those. I jumped in a little too eagerly.


## Thanks for your time
All the best, Louis
